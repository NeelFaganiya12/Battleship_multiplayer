                      The battleship game can be played by first placing all the ships from tthe bottom to the Computer's grid (The grid under the heading "Computer" on the right side). Once that is done, you can click the start button to start the game. When the game starts, player takes the turn first and tries to find the ship in Computer's grid. If the player is succesfull in hitting a ship, the player gets another turn. If the player misses the ship during their turn, then it is computer's turn (which plays automatically). The same miss and hit rules apply to the computer as well. Once computer/player hits all the ships of the opponent, the game is over.

                    <p> 
                        Once you have placed all 5 boats on the Computer grid, only then you will be able to start the game. You can also place a flipped (by 90 degrees) ship.

                        <b>Please note:</b> While placing the ship, the starting position of the ship on the Computer's grid will be the cursor position where your mouse drag stops.

                    When a whole ship has been destroyed, a ship icon will appear on the score board. If player destroys Commputer's ship then the ship icon appears in front of "Player" under score board and vice-versa for Computer. Once computer/player hits all the ships of the opponent, the game is over.
